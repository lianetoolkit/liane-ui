# Liane UI

Design system for Liane

## Tech

We use TSdx

More info https://tsdx.io/

## Dev

From the root folter running `npm run start` we can have our code always updated as we updated the available components

To have a playground while we developing a new component, in a new tab, move to the example folder

```
cd example
npm start
```

That will open a new tab at http://localhost:1234/

The content to be seen is placed in `example/index.tsx` and we can use in here all the components in the src folder

# StoryBook

To open the new one:

`npm run storybook`

Will run up on http://localhost:6006/ and we can check from there how the documentaiton will look like.

# Deploy
